## Support

## ðŸŒŸContributing to Tonic-AI

This guide is designed to help you navigate the process of contributing to the community branch (community) across all projects at Tonic-AI. By following these steps, you'll ensure that your contributions are consistent with our workflow and standards.

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone git@git.tonic-ai.com/aaiburo/aiburo
```

## Contributing

### Step 1: Fetch and Check Out the Feature Branch
To start working on a feature or a bug fix, you'll need to fetch the latest changes from the origin and check out the community feature branch where all development happens. Here's how:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b 'contributing' 'origin/community'
```

**Tip:** If you're working on a specific merge request, you can also check out the branch using the merge request ID.

Tip: If you're working on a specific merge request, you can also check out the branch using the merge request ID.

### Step 2: Create Your Feature Branch

Before making any changes, it's a good practice to create a new branch from the community branch. This ensures that your work is isolated and can be easily merged back. Name your branch in a way that reflects the feature or fix you're working on:

```bash
Copy code
git checkout -b user_name/your_feature_name
```

### Step 3: Review Changes Locally
Once you've checked out the `community`, take some time to review the changes locally on your machine. This step is crucial for understanding the current state of the project and ensuring that your contributions align with the latest developments.

### Step 4: Resolve Any Conflicts
Before you can submit your changes, you need to make sure that your branch is up to date and doesn't have any conflicts with the main `community`. If you encounter conflicts, here's a basic guide on how to fix them:

- Identify Conflicts: Git will list the files that have conflicts after you attempt to merge or rebase your branch with `community`.
- Edit Files: Open the conflicting files in your editor and look for the sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. These markers delineate the conflicting changes from your branch and the `community`.
- Resolve Conflicts: Manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts. This may involve choosing one change over another or merging the changes together in a way that makes sense for the project.
- Mark as Resolved: After you've resolved the conflicts in a file, add it to the staging area using `git add <filename>`.
- Complete the Merge: Once all conflicts are resolved and the changes are staged, continue the rebase or merge process. For a rebase, use `git rebase --continue`.

### Step 5: Push the Source Branch up to GitLab
After you've made your changes and ensured that everything is in order, it's time to push your branch to GitLab:

```bash
git push origin user_name/your_feature_name
```

This command uploads your changes to the `community` on GitLab. From there, you can create a merge request for your changes to be reviewed and eventually merged into the main community branch. The project maintainers will review your merge request. There may be some back and forth with feedback and additional commits if changes are necessary. Once your merge request is approved, it will be merged into the community branch, contributing to the next release.

By following these steps, you ensure that your contributions are well-organized and aligned with the project's workflow, facilitating a smoother integration of your work into the main development branch.

## Best Practices for Contribution
- Keep Commits Small and Focused: Each commit should represent a single logical change. This practice makes it easier to review changes and understand the project's history.
- Write Meaningful Commit Messages: Your commit messages should clearly describe what the commit does and why. This helps other contributors understand your changes and the project's history.
- Stay Up to Date: Regularly fetch and merge changes from `community` to avoid large, complicated merges and ensure your contributions are based on the latest version of the project.
- Test Your Changes: Before submitting your changes, make sure to test them thoroughly. This reduces the chances of introducing bugs into the project.
